   <em>REGULATION (EU) 2019/1873 of 7&#160;November 2019 on the procedures at Border Control Posts for a coordinated performance by competent authorities of intensified official controls on products of animal origin, germinal products, animal by-products and composite products</em>, will implement the following intensified border controls for goods following a non-compliance notified to the European Commission. Following the notification, official controls on consignments, with the same use or origin and with an identifiable listed establishment of origin, including third country vessels, will be intensified at all border control posts (BCPs) in all member states of the EU.</p><h5>Assessment of non-compliance</h5><p>The Commission shall assess the non-compliance against the following requisite conditions, whether&#58;</p><ul><li>suspected fraudulent or deceptive practices, or</li><li>a potentially serious or repeated infringement of EU food and food safety rules Eg. where products of animal origin contain levels of contaminants or residues of veterinary medicinal products which exceed MRLs, or products do not comply with EU microbiological criteria,</li></ul><h5>Consignments excluded from the intensified controls</h5><p>The competent authorities may exclude a consignment from the intensified controls, if the consignment is to be refused on grounds other than the infringement for which intensified controls are performed.</p><h5>Identity and physical checks</h5><p>Following a non-compliance deemed to be subject to EU Regulation 2019/1873, the Member State competent authorities shall carry out identity and physical checks on&#58;</p><ul><li>each consignment coming from the same establishment of origin, and</li><li>containing the same category of goods, for the same type of infringement, as indicated in the EU's Integrated Management System for Official Controls (IMSOC). IMSOC is an internal EU IT system that coordinates reporting between RASFF, EUROPHYT and TRACES.</li></ul><p>If, during the intensified controls, three consignments entering the Union reveal the same type of infringement, the Commission shall request the competent authority of the third country (for Australia this is the Department)&#58;</p><ul><li>make the necessary investigations to identify the reasons for the infringements (called 'imposed checks')</li><li>adopt an action plan to remedy the situation, and</li><li>report back, including the results of the action plan.</li></ul><h5>Termination of the intensified controls</h5><p>The intensified controls shall end under only one of the following three different sets of circumstances&#58;</p><ol><li>A Member State Competent Authority decides to withdraw its notification, reasons must be given</li><li>An uninterrupted sequence of 10&#160;satisfactory results has been recorded in IMSOC [The results do not need to be from the first 10&#160;consignments to be tested but from the first results to be known and submitted in IMSOC], AND<br>The total weight of the consignments with satisfactory results reaches 10 times the weight of the consignment that caused the intensified controls procedure or reaches a net weight of 300&#160;tons, whichever is the lowest.</li><li>Where 'imposed checks' have been requested, an uninterrupted sequence of at least 30 satisfactory results has been recorded in IMSOC, AND<br>The competent authority of the third country has adopted a satisfactory action plan.</li></ol><h6>Costs</h6><p>The costs of the coordinated performance of intensified official controls shall be at the expense of the operator responsible for the consignments that are subject to those controls.
